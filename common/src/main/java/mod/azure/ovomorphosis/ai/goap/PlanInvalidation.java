/**
 * Generic, goal-agnostic replan trigger: compares the {@link WorldStateSnapshot} taken when the current plan was
 * committed against the live world, and reports {@code true} the moment they diverge meaningfully — regardless of
 * whether the currently running {@code Action} has itself noticed anything wrong.
 * <h3>Where this sits relative to existing feedback</h3>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Action.tick() → ActionOutcome.Blocked/Failed → MobBrainRuntime → PlanFeedback         (reactive, per-action)
 * PlanInvalidation.isInvalidated(...)            → GoalApplicator.shouldReplan          (proactive, generic)
 * </pre>
 *
 * {@code PlanFeedback} answers "did the thing I was doing just fail?" {@link PlanInvalidation} answers "does the world
 * still look like it did when I decided to do this?" — a strictly cheaper, upstream question that doesn't require any
 * action to be running, let alone to have failed, in order to fire. Both feed the same
 * {@link GoalApplicator#shouldReplan} gate; this class is the "world-state invalidation above your existing action
 * feedback" half of it.
 * <p>
 * This intentionally only ever <em>unlocks replanning</em> (bypasses the min-commit lock) — it never forces the newly
 * chosen goal to preempt whatever action is currently running. That is still governed entirely by
 * {@code MobBrainRuntime#canPreempt} and each action's {@link mod.azure.ovomorphosis.ai.core.InterruptCategory},
 * exactly as before. Invalidating a plan just means the planner is allowed to reconsider, not that it is forced to act
 * immediately.
