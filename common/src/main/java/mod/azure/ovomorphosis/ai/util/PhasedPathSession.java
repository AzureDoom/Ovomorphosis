/**
 * Chains a sequence of {@link IncrementalPathSession} attempts — e.g. "try the crawl-aware route to the target, then a
 * relaxed-radius crawl route, then a plain ground route, then give up" — while spending only one shared per-tick node
 * budget across the whole chain, instead of each fallback stage running its own separate synchronous search.
 * <h3>Why this exists</h3> Without this, a caller driving {@link IncrementalPathSession} directly still has to decide
 * what to do when a session comes back {@link IncrementalPathSession.Status#FAILED}, and the obvious thing to do —
 * immediately try the next fallback strategy synchronously — defeats the point of incremental budgeting: the mob that
 * carefully amortized its primary search across several ticks can still trigger one big synchronous fallback search the
 * moment that primary search fails. {@link PhasedPathSession} makes the entire fallback chain incremental: if phase 1
 * fails after spending only part of this tick's budget, phase 2 starts immediately with whatever budget is left over
 * <em>this same tick</em> — so the chain still resolves in one tick when it can — but if a phase is still working when
 * the budget runs out, the whole chain reports {@link Status#RUNNING} and picks up again next tick exactly where it
 * left off. This gives a hard upper bound on total search work per mob per tick, however many fallback stages it takes
 * to resolve.
 * <h3>Usage</h3>

 *         () -> IncrementalPathSession.crawling(mob, start, crawlGoal, 96, Math.max(radius, 1), cache)
